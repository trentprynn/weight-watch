## What is this?
Weight Watch is a free, open source web application for tracking your weight over time.

## Why
I wanted an analytics free, app free, website where I can track weight gain / loss progress quickly and easily without a bunch of extras I don't want

## Development
1. Install docker
2. Install `node@16.X` (probably using `nvm`)
3. Install `yarn@1.X` (probably using `homebrew`)
4. Clone to the repo
5. Navigate into each subdirectory `ui` and `api`
6. Follow the steps within each directory's `README.md` to run the project
